While curriculum content and instructional methods often receive primary attention, growing evidence suggests that demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and academic discipline may significantly influence studentsâ€™ academic achievements.\n\nAge has been associated with varying levels of academic maturity, motivation, and learning capacity. Younger students may possess cognitive flexibility but lack the life experience that older students bring to their studies. Similarly, gender disparities in academic performance, often shaped by socio-cultural expectations and opportunities, continue to attract scholarly interest. In Nigeria and beyond, gender-based performance gaps have been observed across academic disciplines, with conflicting findings on whether male or female students outperform their counterparts.\n\nAdditionally, the academic department or field of study introduces another layer of complexity. Differences in academic rigor, grading policies, and student support structures across departments may contribute to observable disparities in academic outcomes. However, using department as a predictor can be statistically problematic due to sample size imbalances and high variability. As such, grouping departments into broader academic units such as colleges offers a more stable and interpretable approach to understanding institutional influences on performance.\n\nThis study aims to examine the influence of age, gender, and college affiliation on the academic performance of graduates from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), using data from the 2023/2024 NYSC mobilization list. Academic performance is operationalized using the class of degree attained, which serves as a reliable proxy in the absence of raw CGPA. By focusing on a single graduating cohort, the study offers a cross-sectional snapshot of demographic and institutional patterns that may underlie academic success. The findings will provide insights into potential equity issues and inform academic support strategies within the university setting.\n\n## Objective of the Study\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of age, gender, college affiliation, and region of origin on the academic performance of graduates from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, using the 2023/2024 NYSC mobilization list.\n\nSpecifically, the study seeks to:\n\n-   Assess the relationship between gender and academic performance among the graduates.\n\n-   Evaluate the extent to which college affiliation (as a proxy for department) affects academic outcomes.\n\n-   Explore the combined effect of age, gender, college affiliation, and region on the class of degree attained.\n\n## Data Description\n\nThis dataset used in this study was obtained from the 2023/24 National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) mobilization list of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB). This dataset comprises information on 3406 graduates who were successfully mobilized for national service.\n\nThe dataset includes demographic, academic, and institutional variables relevant to the analysis of academic performance. Each row in the dataset represents an individual graduate, and the variables collected include:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngt(data.frame(Variable_Name = c(\"matriculation_no\", \"state\", \"courseof_study\", \"class_of_grade\", \"marital_status\",\"gender\", \"date_of_birth\", \"college\", \"department_code\", \"age\", \"region\"), Description = c(\"A unique identifier for each student\", \"The Nigeria state attributed to the graduate\", \"The degree programme pursued by the graduate\",\"The final class of degree awarded to the student\", \"The marital status of the graduate (Married or Single)\",\"The sex of the graduate (Male or Female)\",\"The graduate date of birth\", \"The academic unit or faculty under which the student graduated\", \"Abbreviated code representing the graduate's department\", \"Age of graduate\", \"The Nigeria region attributed to the graduate\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"puhymvwbsr\"

were loaded, including tidyverse, gt, here, janitor, lubridate, and visdat, which collectively support data manipulation, visualization, and cleaning. Following this, the NYSC dataset was imported into the R environment. An initial assessment was conducted to determine the dataset's structure, including the number of rows and columns, and to preview the first ten records.\n\nThe properties of each variable were inspected to understand data types and formats. Special attention was given to the Date of Graduation column, which was found to contain a substantial number of missing values. This observation was first noted during the structure inspection and subsequently confirmed using summary statistics and missing value checks.\n\nTo preserve confidentiality and ensure ethical data handling, columns containing sensitive or personally identifiable information such as names, phone numbers,jamb registration number and matric numbers were excluded from the working dataset.

This comparison allows for a broader understanding of how academic outcomes vary not only by gender but also by institutional affiliation.\n\nAs shown above, the chart provides a visual summary of how graduates from various colleges are represented within each degree classification (for example, First Class, Second Class Upper, and so on). While certain patterns may be visually apparent, such as possible concentrations of specific degree classes within some colleges, these observations are not enough to determine whether a meaningful relationship exists between college and academic performance.\n\nBecause both variables, college and class of degree, are categorical, visual inspection alone is not sufficient. Any apparent differences might be due to random variation. To formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists, a Chi square test of independence is necessary. This will determine whether college affiliation is associated with academic performance or whether the observed differences occurred by chance.\n\n#### Chi-Square Test of independence\n\nH~o~: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\n\nH~1~: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab <- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %>% #Parsing college and class of grade into a table\n  filter(college %in% c(\"COLANIM\", \"COLAMRUD\",\"COLENG\", \"COLBIOS\", \"COLFHEC\", \"COLERM\", \"COLPLANT\", \"COLVET\", \"COLPHYS\")) %>% # filtering COLMAS out since just one graduate was produced by this college\n  dplyr::select(college, class_of_grade) %>% \n  droplevels() # This drops the filtered COLMAS entry\n\n  \ncross_tab <- table(tab)\ncross_tab\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          class_of_grade\ncollege    Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n  COLAMRUD           3                144                194          20\n  COLANIM            9                238                249          28\n  COLBIOS           16                170                236          16\n  COLENG             3                 64                107          19\n  COLERM            16                168                159          10\n  COLFHEC            5                123                293          12\n  COLPHYS           44                333                225           6\n  COLPLANT           9                290                154           9\n  COLVET             0                 11                 20           2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this phase of the analysis, the objective is to determine whether there is a significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained among the graduates under study. While the dataset contains a large overall number of observations, certain combinations of college and class of degree â€” particularly those representing less common degree classifications within specific colleges â€” have small observed and expected counts. This violates the minimum expected frequency requirement, meaning that the standard Chi-square testâ€™s p-value may be unreliable.\n\nTo address this issue, the Monte Carlo simulation version of the Chi-square test was employed. This method involves generating a large number of random contingency tables under the assumption of independence, with the marginal totals fixed. For each simulated table, the Chi-square statistic is calculated, and the p-value is estimated empirically as the proportion of simulated statistics equal to or greater than the observed statistic.\n\nBy using this approach, the analysis accounts for the uneven distribution of observations across categories, ensuring that the statistical inference regarding the relationship between college affiliation and class of degree is both valid and robust, even in the presence of small expected counts in some cells.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncross_tab%>% \n  chisq.test(simulate.p.value = T, B = 3400)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tPearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 3400\n\treplicates)\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 266.99, df = NA, p-value = 0.000294\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Decision rule:** If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between college and academic achievement. Hence, we conclude that there is a difference in college proportion across the class of degree groups.\n\n#### Post-Hoc Test\n\nThe Monte Carlo Chi-square test of independence revealed a statistically significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained. While this finding establishes that a relationship exists, the Chi-square test does not indicate which specific combinations of categories contribute most to the association. To gain deeper insight, a post hoc analysis will be conducted.\n\nThrough this post hoc analysis, the study not only confirms the presence of a relationship between college affiliation and class of degree but also pinpoints the specific areas where the patterns differ, thereby providing more actionable and interpretable findings.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(200)\nrcompanion::pairwiseNominalIndependence(cross_tab,\n                            fisher = T,\n                            gtest = F,\n                            chisq = T,\n                            cramer = T,\n                            simulate.p.value = T, \n                            B = 3400\n                           )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            Comparison p.Fisher p.adj.Fisher  p.Chisq p.adj.Chisq Cramer.V\n1   COLAMRUD : COLANIM 0.223000     0.259000 0.213000    0.247000   0.0707\n2   COLAMRUD : COLBIOS 0.032000     0.042700 0.046200    0.061600   0.1020\n3    COLAMRUD : COLENG 0.133000     0.165000 0.141000    0.175000   0.0996\n4    COLAMRUD : COLERM 0.000294     0.000623 0.000588    0.001250   0.1560\n5   COLAMRUD : COLFHEC 0.001180     0.002240 0.000294    0.000706   0.1500\n6   COLAMRUD : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2520\n7  COLAMRUD : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2450\n8    COLAMRUD : COLVET 0.779000     0.801000 0.805000    0.828000   0.0473\n9    COLANIM : COLBIOS 0.022100     0.031800 0.024100    0.033400   0.0983\n10    COLANIM : COLENG 0.010000     0.015000 0.009410    0.014600   0.1250\n11    COLANIM : COLERM 0.023200     0.032100 0.021500    0.031000   0.1040\n12   COLANIM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2030\n13   COLANIM : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2070\n14  COLANIM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.1840\n15    COLANIM : COLVET 0.455000     0.512000 0.414000    0.466000   0.0698\n16    COLBIOS : COLENG 0.007350     0.011500 0.006760    0.011600   0.1400\n17    COLBIOS : COLERM 0.063200     0.081300 0.063500    0.081600   0.0964\n18   COLBIOS : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.001180    0.002240   0.1510\n19   COLBIOS : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2060\n20  COLBIOS : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2400\n21    COLBIOS : COLVET 0.537000     0.569000 0.553000    0.603000   0.0678\n22     COLENG : COLERM 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2080\n23    COLENG : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000882    0.001760   0.1690\n24    COLENG : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2970\n25   COLENG : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2990\n26     COLENG : COLVET 0.931000     0.931000 0.833000    0.833000   0.0692\n27    COLERM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2390\n28    COLERM : COLPHYS 0.004700     0.007690 0.003530    0.006350   0.1160\n29   COLERM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.1580\n30     COLERM : COLVET 0.141000     0.169000 0.149000    0.179000   0.1180\n31   COLFHEC : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.3290\n32  COLFHEC : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.3530\n33    COLFHEC : COLVET 0.491000     0.536000 0.575000    0.609000   0.0650\n34  COLPHYS : COLPLANT 0.000588     0.001180 0.000588    0.001250   0.1380\n35    COLPHYS : COLVET 0.002350     0.004030 0.007940    0.013000   0.1580\n36   COLPLANT : COLVET 0.002060     0.003710 0.009700    0.014600   0.1680\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPost hoc pairwise comparisons using the Chi-square test with Bonferroni adjustment revealed several significant differences in class-of-degree distribution between colleges.

Age may account for variations in academic maturity, while gender could reflect potential disparities in academic engagement or performance. College affiliation captures institutional differences in academic standards, available resources, and programme demands. Modelling these predictors jointly allows for the assessment of both main effects and interaction terms, providing insight into whether the influence of one variable depends on the level of another. This approach ensures a comprehensive statistical evaluation of the multifactorial determinants of academic achievement.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_orl <- polr(class_of_grade ~ age + college + gender, data = nysc_list_modified_cleaned, Hess = T)\n\nctable <- coef(summary(model_orl))\n\np <- pnorm(abs(ctable[, \"t value\"]), lower.tail = F) * 2\n\nOR <- exp(coef(model_orl))\n\nresult <- cbind(ctable[1:11,1:3], \"Odds ratio\" = OR , \"P value\"= p[1:11])\nresult\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                       Value   Std.

Statistically significant at p \\< 0.05\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLBIOS reduces the odds of being in higher category by 28%. Statistically significant at p \\< 0.05\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLENG increases the odds of being in higher category by 70%. Highy significant at p \\< 0.01\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLERM reduces the odds of being in higher category by 45.7%. Highly significant at p \\< 0.01\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLFHEC has small effect and the effect is not statistically significant(p \\> 0.05)\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLMAS has extremely large negative effect and this is due to the fact that the college produced one graduate for the 2023/24 Academic session\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLPHYS reduces odds of being in the higher category by 61%. Extremely significant at p \\< 0.01\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLPLANT reduces the odds of being in the higher category by 63%. Extremely significant at p \\< 0.01\n\n-   Compared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLVET increases the odds of being in the higher category by 32%. Not statistically significant(p \\> 0.05)\n\n-   Compared to being female, being male reduces the odds of being in a higher category by 50%. Extremely significant at p \\< 0.01\n\nGender:\n\nMale: OR = 0.50, p â‰ˆ 5.18e-21 â†’ Males have about half the odds of being in a higher outcome category compared to females, highly significant.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n-   being male, or being in several of the colleges above strongly reduces the odds of higher class of degree/grade.\n\n-   being in Engineering increases odds of higher class of degree/grade\n\n-   age doesn't seem to matter much in this study.\n\n## Limitations of the Study\n\n-   Model Evaluation Constraints The study could not fully assess the overall model significance due to incomplete deviance-related outputs. Specifically, the null deviance was unavailable, making it impossible to perform a formal likelihood ratio test to compare the fitted model against a null model. While the AIC was computed, its interpretation was limited without the corresponding null deviance and model comparison context.\n\n-   Data Availability The analysis was constrained by the availability and completeness of the dataset. Some potentially relevant variables were either missing or aggregated, limiting the ability to explore more granular relationships and potential confounders.\n\n-   Scope of the Study The study was conducted within a specific context and timeframe, focusing only on the variables included in the available dataset. This scope restriction means the findings may not be directly generalizable to other settings or populations without further validation.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n-   Since the chi-square test showed significant associations between certain demographic variables (gender/ college affiliation) and academic performance, students should be aware of the patterns and challenges associated with their group and seek targeted academic support where necessary.\n\n-   Results indicate that gender significantly influences the likelihood of attaining higher academic classes. This highlights the importance of encouraging male students to actively seek additional academic support, mentoring, and engagement in learning activities. Student leaders and academic bodies could implement targeted study groups, skill-building workshops, and counseling programs aimed at bridging potential performance gaps.\n\n-   Where performance differences were observed between colleges or demographic categories, students can benefit from cross-college study groups or mentorship to share strategies that work in high-performing clusters.\n\n-   Students falling into categories with lower predicted probabilities of high academic achievement (based on the regression model) should seek academic counselling early, utilize available resources, and adopt structured study plans to improve outcomes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study successfully applied chi-square test of independence to evaluate the association between the categorical variables and ordinal logistic regression to examine the relationship between predictor variables and the ordered outcome. The ordered logistioc model identified significant predictors and provided interpretable odds ratios, enhancing understanding of how the independent variables influence the likelihood of moving between categories. However, while the findings are insightful, they should be interpreted in light of the studyâ€™s limitations, especially regarding sample scope, potential omitted variables, and model assumptions. Future research incorporating broader, more diverse datasets and robust assumption checks will help validate and extend these results.\n",
