    "text": "Data Exploration, Cleaning, Manipulation and Transformation\nTo begin the analysis, the necessary R packages were loaded, including tidyverse, gt, here, janitor, lubridate, and visdat, which collectively support data manipulation, visualization, and cleaning. Following this, the NYSC dataset was imported into the R environment. An initial assessment was conducted to determine the dataset’s structure, including the number of rows and columns, and to preview the first ten records.\nThe properties of each variable were inspected to understand data types and formats. Special attention was given to the Date of Graduation column, which was found to contain a substantial number of missing values. This observation was first noted during the structure inspection and subsequently confirmed using summary statistics and missing value checks.\nTo preserve confidentiality and ensure ethical data handling, columns containing sensitive or personally identifiable information such as names, phone numbers,jamb registration number and matric numbers were excluded from the working dataset. A new CSV file was then generated to store this modified version of the dataset.\nFinally, data cleaning and transformation were carried out on the refined dataset. This included tasks such as deriving new variables (age and region), and preparing the data for statistical analysis.\n\nData Exploration\n\n\nCode\n#nysc &lt;- read_csv(here(\"Data/NYSC.csv\"))    # Loading the dataset into R\n\n#dim(nysc) # Investigating the dimension of the dataset\n\n#head(nysc, n= 10) # Exploring the first 10 rows of the dataset\n\n#glimpse(nysc)    # Investigating the properties of the dataset\n\n#sum(is.na(nysc$`Date of Graduation`))    # Investigating the number of missing values in the Date of Graduation colunm\n\n#nysc_list &lt;- nysc %&gt;% # Dropping private information columns and the column with no entry\n  #mutate(id = str_sub(JambNumber, -8, -1)) %&gt;% \n  #select(-c(Firstname,Middlename, Surname, MatriculationNo,JambNumber, Phone, `Date of Graduation`)) %&gt;% \n  #select(id, everything()) # This ensures the id column comes first in the dataset\n  \n\n#write_csv(nysc_list,\"nysc_modified.csv\") # Creating a csv file for the modified dataset\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts/Academic performance/data/nysc_modified.csv\")) # Loading the modified dataset into R\n\nvis_dat(nysc_list_modified) # Visualizing the dataset to investigate it's properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned &lt;- nysc_list_modified %&gt;%    # Cleaning the column name for consistency\n    clean_names()\n\ndup &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;%  # Identifying duplicated rows based on matriculation number\n  get_dupes(id)\n\n\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;%    # Dropping duplicated rows\n  unique()\n\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;%    # Changing the class of some of our categorical variable to allow for efficient data analysis\n  mutate(class_of_grade = factor(class_of_grade,\n                                     levels = c(\"Third Class\",\"Second Class Lower\", \"Second Class Upper\", \"First Class\"), \n                                 ordered = T),\n         gender = factor(gender),\n         college = factor(college))\n\n# nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # This was done to have a thorough look at each unique entry of each column of the dataset in order to have the dataset cleaned appropriately.

It offers an initial impression of how male and female graduates are spread across the different classifications of academic achievement (such as First Class, Second Class Upper, etc.). While the chart reveals some observable patterns such as possible concentration or variation in specific degree classes for each gender, it does not offer conclusive evidence of a statistically significant relationship between gender and academic performance.\nGiven that both variables involved are categorical in nature (gender and class of degree), visual inspection alone is insufficient to determine whether an association truly exists between them or if any observed differences are simply due to random variation. Therefore, to formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists between gender and academic performance, it is necessary to conduct a Chi-square test of independence. This test will help determine whether the variables are associated or independent of one another.\n\nChi-Square Test of Independence\nHo: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\nH1: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Parsing gender and class of grade into a table\n  dplyr::select(gender,class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  table()\n\n\n      class_of_grade\ngender Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n     F          23                598                931          65\n     M          83                943                706          57\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Finding the chi-square test of independence\n  dplyr::select(gender,class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  table() %&gt;%  \n  chisq.test()\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 134.31, df = 3, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nDecision rule: If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\nConclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between gender and academic achievement. Hence, we conclude that there is a difference in gender proportion across the class of degree groups.\n\n\n\nCollege as a Predictor of Academic Achievement\n\nIs college associated with academic achievement?\n\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% \n  filter(college %in% c(\"COLANIM\", \"COLAMRUD\",\"COLENG\", \"COLBIOS\", \"COLFHEC\", \"COLERM\", \"COLPLANT\", \"COLVET\", \"COLPHYS\")) %&gt;% # \n  droplevels() %&gt;% # COLMAS was filtered and dropped because she produced just one graduate\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x =class_of_grade,fill =  college)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Class of Grade\",\n       fill = \"College\",\n       title = \"Proportion of college Within Each Class of Grade\",\n       caption = \"Source: FUNAAB 2023/24 NYSC List\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,\n                                  face = \"bold\",\n                                  size = 18))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the earlier bar chart on gender and academic performance, which offered insight into how degree classifications are distributed across male and female graduates, the current bar chart extends this exploration by examining the distribution of academic performance across different colleges. This comparison allows for a broader understanding of how academic outcomes vary not only by gender but also by institutional affiliation.\nAs shown above, the chart provides a visual summary of how graduates from various colleges are represented within each degree classification (for example, First Class, Second Class Upper, and so on). While certain patterns may be visually apparent, such as possible concentrations of specific degree classes within some colleges, these observations are not enough to determine whether a meaningful relationship exists between college and academic performance.\nBecause both variables, college and class of degree, are categorical, visual inspection alone is not sufficient. Any apparent differences might be due to random variation. To formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists, a Chi square test of independence is necessary. This will determine whether college affiliation is associated with academic performance or whether the observed differences occurred by chance.\n\nChi-Square Test of independence\nHo: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\nH1: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\ntab &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% #Parsing college and class of grade into a table\n  filter(college %in% c(\"COLANIM\", \"COLAMRUD\",\"COLENG\", \"COLBIOS\", \"COLFHEC\", \"COLERM\", \"COLPLANT\", \"COLVET\", \"COLPHYS\")) %&gt;% # filtering COLMAS out since just one graduate was produced by this college\n  dplyr::select(college, class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  droplevels() # This drops the filtered COLMAS entry\n\n  \ncross_tab &lt;- table(tab)\ncross_tab\n\n\n          class_of_grade\ncollege    Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n  COLAMRUD           3                144                194          20\n  COLANIM            9                238                249          28\n  COLBIOS           16                170                236          16\n  COLENG             3                 64                107          19\n  COLERM            16                168                159          10\n  COLFHEC            5                123                293          12\n  COLPHYS           44                333                225           6\n  COLPLANT           9                290                154           9\n  COLVET             0                 11                 20           2\n\n\nIn this phase of the analysis, the objective is to determine whether there is a significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained among the graduates under study. While the dataset contains a large overall number of observations, certain combinations of college and class of degree — particularly those representing less common degree classifications within specific colleges — have small observed and expected counts. This violates the minimum expected frequency requirement, meaning that the standard Chi-square test’s p-value may be unreliable.\nTo address this issue, the Monte Carlo simulation version of the Chi-square test was employed. This method involves generating a large number of random contingency tables under the assumption of independence, with the marginal totals fixed. For each simulated table, the Chi-square statistic is calculated, and the p-value is estimated empirically as the proportion of simulated statistics equal to or greater than the observed statistic.\nBy using this approach, the analysis accounts for the uneven distribution of observations across categories, ensuring that the statistical inference regarding the relationship between college affiliation and class of degree is both valid and robust, even in the presence of small expected counts in some cells.\n\n\nCode\ncross_tab%&gt;% \n  chisq.test(simulate.p.value = T, B = 3400)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 3400\n    replicates)\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 266.99, df = NA, p-value = 0.000294\n\n\nDecision rule: If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\nConclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between college and academic achievement. Hence, we conclude that there is a difference in college proportion across the class of degree groups.\n\n\nPost-Hoc Test\nThe Monte Carlo Chi-square test of independence revealed a statistically significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained. While this finding establishes that a relationship exists, the Chi-square test does not indicate which specific combinations of categories contribute most to the association. To gain deeper insight, a post hoc analysis will be conducted.\nThrough this post hoc analysis, the study not only confirms the presence of a relationship between college affiliation and class of degree but also pinpoints the specific areas where the patterns differ, thereby providing more actionable and interpretable findings.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(200)\nrcompanion::pairwiseNominalIndependence(cross_tab,\n                            fisher = T,\n                            gtest = F,\n                            chisq = T,\n                            cramer = T,\n                            simulate.p.value = T, \n                            B = 3400\n                           )\n\n\n            Comparison p.Fisher p.adj.Fisher  p.Chisq p.adj.Chisq Cramer.V\n1   COLAMRUD : COLANIM 0.223000     0.259000 0.213000    0.247000   0.0707\n2   COLAMRUD : COLBIOS 0.032000     0.042700 0.046200    0.061600   0.1020\n3    COLAMRUD : COLENG 0.133000     0.165000 0.141000    0.175000   0.0996\n4    COLAMRUD : COLERM 0.000294     0.000623 0.000588    0.001250   0.1560\n5   COLAMRUD : COLFHEC 0.001180     0.002240 0.000294    0.000706   0.1500\n6   COLAMRUD : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2520\n7  COLAMRUD : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2450\n8    COLAMRUD : COLVET 0.779000     0.801000 0.805000    0.828000   0.0473\n9    COLANIM : COLBIOS 0.022100     0.031800 0.024100    0.033400   0.0983\n10    COLANIM : COLENG 0.010000     0.015000 0.009410    0.014600   0.1250\n11    COLANIM : COLERM 0.023200     0.032100 0.021500    0.031000   0.1040\n12   COLANIM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2030\n13   COLANIM : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2070\n14  COLANIM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.1840\n15    COLANIM : COLVET 0.455000     0.512000 0.414000    0.466000   0.0698\n16    COLBIOS : COLENG 0.007350     0.011500 0.006760    0.011600   0.1400\n17    COLBIOS : COLERM 0.063200     0.081300 0.063500    0.081600   0.0964\n18   COLBIOS : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.001180    0.002240   0.1510\n19   COLBIOS : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2060\n20  COLBIOS : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2400\n21    COLBIOS : COLVET 0.537000     0.569000 0.553000    0.603000   0.0678\n22     COLENG : COLERM 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2080\n23    COLENG : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000882    0.001760   0.1690\n24    COLENG : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2970\n25   COLENG : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2990\n26     COLENG : COLVET 0.931000     0.931000 0.833000    0.833000   0.0692\n27    COLERM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2390\n28    COLERM : COLPHYS 0.004700     0.007690 0.003530    0.006350   0.1160\n29   COLERM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.1580\n30     COLERM : COLVET 0.141000     0.169000 0.149000    0.179000   0.1180\n31   COLFHEC : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.3290\n32  COLFHEC : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.3530\n33    COLFHEC : COLVET 0.491000     0.536000 0.575000    0.609000   0.0650\n34  COLPHYS : COLPLANT 0.000588     0.001180 0.000588    0.001250   0.1380\n35    COLPHYS : COLVET 0.002350     0.004030 0.007940    0.013000   0.1580\n36   COLPLANT : COLVET 0.002060     0.003710 0.009700    0.014600   0.1680\n\n\nPost hoc pairwise comparisons using the Chi-square test with Bonferroni adjustment revealed several significant differences in class-of-degree distribution between colleges. Notably, the difference between COLFHEC and COLPLANT was statistically significant (adjusted p = 0.000706) with a Cramér’s V of 0.353, indicating a medium association. Similarly, COLENG vs. COLPHYS (adjusted p = 0.000706, Cramér’s V = 0.297) and COLFHEC vs. COLPHYS (adjusted p = 0.00076, Cramér’s V = 0.329) showed moderate associations. Other significant comparisons, such as COLPHYS vs. COLPLANT (adjusted p = 0.00125, Cramér’s V = 0.138), had smaller effect sizes, suggesting weaker practical differences despite statistical significance.\n\n\n\nCombined Effect of Age, Gender, College Affiliation on the Class of Degree Attained\nThe combined effect of age, gender and college affiliation on the class of degree attained can be examined within the framework of an ordinal logistic regression model, since the class of degree is an ordered categorical outcome. Age may account for variations in academic maturity, while gender could reflect potential disparities in academic engagement or performance. College affiliation captures institutional differences in academic standards, available resources, and programme demands. Modelling these predictors jointly allows for the assessment of both main effects and interaction terms, providing insight into whether the influence of one variable depends on the level of another. This approach ensures a comprehensive statistical evaluation of the multifactorial determinants of academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_orl &lt;- polr(class_of_grade ~ age + college + gender, data = nysc_list_modified_cleaned, Hess = T)\n\nctable &lt;- coef(summary(model_orl))\n\np &lt;- pnorm(abs(ctable[, \"t value\"]), lower.tail = F) * 2\n\nOR &lt;- exp(coef(model_orl))\n\nresult &lt;- cbind(ctable[1:11,1:3], \"Odds ratio\" = OR , \"P value\"= p[1:11])\nresult\n\n\n                       Value   Std.

Statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLBIOS reduces the odds of being in higher category by 28%. Statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLENG increases the odds of being in higher category by 70%. Highy significant at p &lt; 0.01\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLERM reduces the odds of being in higher category by 45.7%. Highly significant at p &lt; 0.01\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLFHEC has small effect and the effect is not statistically significant(p &gt; 0.05)\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLMAS has extremely large negative effect and this is due to the fact that the college produced one graduate for the 2023/24 Academic session\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLPHYS reduces odds of being in the higher category by 61%. Extremely significant at p &lt; 0.01\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLPLANT reduces the odds of being in the higher category by 63%. Extremely significant at p &lt; 0.01\nCompared to the reference group(COLAMRUD), being in COLVET increases the odds of being in the higher category by 32%. Not statistically significant(p &gt; 0.05)\nCompared to being female, being male reduces the odds of being in a higher category by 50%. Extremely significant at p &lt; 0.01\n\nGender:\nMale: OR = 0.50, p ≈ 5.18e-21 → Males have about half the odds of being in a higher outcome category compared to females, highly significant.\nIn summary:\n\nbeing male, or being in several of the colleges above strongly reduces the odds of higher class of degree/grade.\nbeing in Engineering increases odds of higher class of degree/grade\nage doesn’t seem to matter much in this study."

    "section": "Limitations of the Study",
    "text": "Limitations of the Study\n\nModel Evaluation Constraints The study could not fully assess the overall model significance due to incomplete deviance-related outputs. Specifically, the null deviance was unavailable, making it impossible to perform a formal likelihood ratio test to compare the fitted model against a null model. While the AIC was computed, its interpretation was limited without the corresponding null deviance and model comparison context.\nData Availability The analysis was constrained by the availability and completeness of the dataset. Some potentially relevant variables were either missing or aggregated, limiting the ability to explore more granular relationships and potential confounders.\nScope of the Study The study was conducted within a specific context and timeframe, focusing only on the variables included in the available dataset. This scope restriction means the findings may not be directly generalizable to other settings or populations without further validation."

    "section": "Recommendations",
    "text": "Recommendations\n\nSince the chi-square test showed significant associations between certain demographic variables (gender/ college affiliation) and academic performance, students should be aware of the patterns and challenges associated with their group and seek targeted academic support where necessary.\nResults indicate that gender significantly influences the likelihood of attaining higher academic classes. This highlights the importance of encouraging male students to actively seek additional academic support, mentoring, and engagement in learning activities. Student leaders and academic bodies could implement targeted study groups, skill-building workshops, and counseling programs aimed at bridging potential performance gaps.\nWhere performance differences were observed between colleges or demographic categories, students can benefit from cross-college study groups or mentorship to share strategies that work in high-performing clusters.\nStudents falling into categories with lower predicted probabilities of high academic achievement (based on the regression model) should seek academic counselling early, utilize available resources, and adopt structured study plans to improve outcomes."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis study successfully applied chi-square test of independence to evaluate the association between the categorical variables and ordinal logistic regression to examine the relationship between predictor variables and the ordered outcome. The ordered logistioc model identified significant predictors and provided interpretable odds ratios, enhancing understanding of how the independent variables influence the likelihood of moving between categories. However, while the findings are insightful, they should be interpreted in light of the study’s limitations, especially regarding sample scope, potential omitted variables, and model assumptions. Future research incorporating broader, more diverse datasets and robust assumption checks will help validate and extend these results."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe National Football League (NFL) is the premier professional American football league in the United States and one of the most popular sports organization in the world. Established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) and renamed the NFL in 1922, the league has grown into a cultural and economic powerhouse. It consists of 32 franchise, evenly splitted between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC), each competing in a highly structured season followed by the NFL Playoffs and culminating in the globally renowned Super Bowl\nBeyond its sporting appeal, the NFL represents a rich source of data for performance analytics, sports economics, and fan engagement studies. Player statistics, team performance metrics, play-by-play data, and injury reports provide a detailed view of how the game evolves over time."

    "text": "Data Importation, Transformation, Manipulation and Analysis\nThis phase of the project commenced with the importation of the necessary R libraries required for efficient data handling, transformation, visualization, and analysis. The core packages included:\n\nnflreadr – for accessing and importing publicly available NFL datasets.\ntidyverse – metapackage\njanitor - for data cleaning\n\nUsing the nflreadr package, the required dataset was imported directly into R; the play-by-play dataset to be precise. the play-by-play dataset for the chosen season was retrieved using the load_pbp() function. Upon loading, dataset structure and variable names were inspected using functions such as str(), dim(), and names() to gain a preliminary understanding of its composition.\nThereafter, the first ten rows of the dataset were examined using the head() function to understand the entries of each column. This inspection provided insight into the type of data contained in each variable, the consistency of entries, and potential areas requiring preprocessing. During the course of this exploration, variables of interest was identified and selected for the analysis.\n\nData Loading and Exploration\n\n\nCode\npbp &lt;- load_pbp(2023)\nplan(\"sequential\")\n\nd &lt;- dim(pbp)\ng &lt;- glimpse(pbp)\n\n\nRows: 49,665\nColumns: 372\n$ play_id                              &lt;dbl&gt;

    "text": "Data Cleaning, Preparation and Analysis\nThis phase of the project commenced with the importation of the necessary R libraries required for efficient data handling, transformation, visualization, and analysis. The core packages included:\n\nnflreadr – for accessing and importing publicly available NFL datasets.\ntidyverse – metapackage\njanitor - for data cleaning\n\nUsing the nflreadr package, the required dataset was imported directly into R; the play-by-play dataset to be precise. The play-by-play dataset for the chosen season was retrieved using the load_pbp() function. Upon loading, dataset structure and variable names were inspected using functions such as glimpse() and dim() to gain a preliminary understanding of its composition.\nThereafter, the first ten rows of the dataset were examined using the head() function to understand the entries of each column. This inspection provided insight into the type of data contained in each variable, the consistency of entries, and potential areas requiring preprocessing. It was observed that entries(game_id) were duplicated to collect data for different play type(kick off, run, pass, punt, no_play, extra_point, field_goal, qb_kneel, qb_spike). Apparently, the dataset contains an exceptionally large number of rows due to its play-by-play structure, where each row represents a single play rather than a single game. During the course of this exploration, variables of interest were identified and selected for the analysis.\n\nData Cleaning and Preparation\n\n\nCode\npbp &lt;- load_pbp(2023)\nplan(\"sequential\")\n\n# dim(pbp)  # Investigating the number of rows and columns in the dataset\n# glimpse(pbp) # Investigating the properties of the dataset\n# head(pbp, n =10) # Inspecting the first 10 rows of the dataset\n# pbp %&gt;%   # Investigating the number of duplicated entries\n  #get_dupes(game_id)\n\n#is.na(pbp) # Investigating the columns with missing value\n\npbp_selected &lt;- pbp %&gt;%  # Selecting the columns of interest\n  select(game_id, week, home_team, away_team,season_type,game_date,result,home_score,away_score)\n\n#pbp_selected %&gt;% # Inspecting the home_team columns for inconsistency\n  #select(home_team) %&gt;% \n  #unique()\n\n#pbp_selected %&gt;% # Inspecting the away_team columns for inconsistency\n  #select(away_team) %&gt;% \n  #unique()\n\n#pbp_selected %&gt;% # Inspecting the season_type columns for inconsistency\n  #select(season_type) %&gt;% \n  #unique()\n\npbp_selected &lt;- pbp_selected %&gt;%  # Dropping duplicate entries\n  unique()\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the dataset to identify the team who won the SUPER BOWL\n\n\nCode\npbp_selected_post &lt;- pbp_selected %&gt;% # Filtering the dataset to include only SUPER BOWL matches\n  filter(season_type == \"POST\")\n\n\npbp_post_winners &lt;- pbp_selected_post %&gt;% # Creating a new column for the winning teams across the matches played\n  mutate(home_winner = result &gt;0, \n         winning_team = case_when(home_winner == T ~ home_team,\n                                  home_winner == F ~ away_team))\n\npbp_post_winners %&gt;%  # filtering by week and selecting the winning team column to identify 2023/24 season Super Bowl winner\n  filter(week == 22) %&gt;% \n  select(winning_team)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  winning_team\n  &lt;chr&gt;
