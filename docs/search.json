    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nAcademic performance remains a central concern for educators, policymakers, and researchers, especially in higher education institutions where various individual and institutional factors may shape students’ academic outcomes. While curriculum content and instructional methods often receive primary attention, growing evidence suggests that demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and academic discipline may significantly influence students’ academic achievements.\nAge has been associated with varying levels of academic maturity, motivation, and learning capacity. Younger students may possess cognitive flexibility but lack the life experience that older students bring to their studies. Similarly, gender disparities in academic performance, often shaped by socio-cultural expectations and opportunities, continue to attract scholarly interest. In Nigeria and beyond, gender-based performance gaps have been observed across academic disciplines, with conflicting findings on whether male or female students outperform their counterparts.\nAdditionally, the academic department or field of study introduces another layer of complexity. Differences in academic rigor, grading policies, and student support structures across departments may contribute to observable disparities in academic outcomes. However, using department as a predictor can be statistically problematic due to sample size imbalances and high variability. As such, grouping departments into broader academic units such as colleges offers a more stable and interpretable approach to understanding institutional influences on performance.\nThis study aims to examine the influence of age, gender, and college affiliation on the academic performance of graduates from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), using data from the 2023/2024 NYSC mobilization list. Academic performance is operationalized using the class of degree attained, which serves as a reliable proxy in the absence of raw CGPA. By focusing on a single graduating cohort, the study offers a cross-sectional snapshot of demographic and institutional patterns that may underlie academic success. The findings will provide insights into potential equity issues and inform academic support strategies within the university setting."

Following this, the NYSC dataset was imported into the R environment. An initial assessment was conducted to determine the dataset’s structure, including the number of rows and columns, and to preview the first ten records.\nThe properties of each variable were inspected to understand data types and formats. Special attention was given to the Date of Graduation column, which was found to contain a substantial number of missing values. This observation was first noted during the structure inspection and subsequently confirmed using summary statistics and missing value checks.\nTo preserve confidentiality and ensure ethical data handling, columns containing sensitive or personally identifiable information such as names, phone numbers,jamb registration number and matric numbers were excluded from the working dataset.

It offers an initial impression of how male and female graduates are spread across the different classifications of academic achievement (such as First Class, Second Class Upper, etc.). While the chart reveals some observable patterns such as possible concentration or variation in specific degree classes for each gender, it does not offer conclusive evidence of a statistically significant relationship between gender and academic performance.\nGiven that both variables involved are categorical in nature (gender and class of degree), visual inspection alone is insufficient to determine whether an association truly exists between them or if any observed differences are simply due to random variation. Therefore, to formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists between gender and academic performance, it is necessary to conduct a Chi-square test of independence. This test will help determine whether the variables are associated or independent of one another.\n\nChi-Square Test of Independence\nHo: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\nH1: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Parsing gender and class of grade into a table\n  dplyr::select(gender,class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  table()\n\n\n      class_of_grade\ngender Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n     F          23                598                931          65\n     M          83                943                706          57\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Finding the chi-square test of independence\n  dplyr::select(gender,class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  table() %&gt;%  \n  chisq.test()\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 134.31, df = 3, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nDecision rule: If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\nConclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between gender and academic achievement. Hence, we conclude that there is a difference in gender proportion across the class of degree groups.\n\n\n\nCollege as a Predictor of Academic Achievement\n\nIs college associated with academic achievement?\n\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% \n  filter(college %in% c(\"COLANIM\", \"COLAMRUD\",\"COLENG\", \"COLBIOS\", \"COLFHEC\", \"COLERM\", \"COLPLANT\", \"COLVET\", \"COLPHYS\")) %&gt;% # \n  droplevels() %&gt;% # COLMAS was filtered and dropped because she produced just one graduate\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x =class_of_grade,fill =  college)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Class of Grade\",\n       fill = \"College\",\n       title = \"Proportion of college Within Each Class of Grade\",\n       caption = \"Source: FUNAAB 2023/24 NYSC List\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,\n                                  face = \"bold\",\n                                  size = 18))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the earlier bar chart on gender and academic performance, which offered insight into how degree classifications are distributed across male and female graduates, the current bar chart extends this exploration by examining the distribution of academic performance across different colleges. This comparison allows for a broader understanding of how academic outcomes vary not only by gender but also by institutional affiliation.\nAs shown above, the chart provides a visual summary of how graduates from various colleges are represented within each degree classification (for example, First Class, Second Class Upper, and so on). While certain patterns may be visually apparent, such as possible concentrations of specific degree classes within some colleges, these observations are not enough to determine whether a meaningful relationship exists between college and academic performance.\nBecause both variables, college and class of degree, are categorical, visual inspection alone is not sufficient. Any apparent differences might be due to random variation. To formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists, a Chi square test of independence is necessary. This will determine whether college affiliation is associated with academic performance or whether the observed differences occurred by chance.\n\nChi-Square Test of independence\nHo: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\nH1: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\ntab &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% #Parsing college and class of grade into a table\n  filter(college %in% c(\"COLANIM\", \"COLAMRUD\",\"COLENG\", \"COLBIOS\", \"COLFHEC\", \"COLERM\", \"COLPLANT\", \"COLVET\", \"COLPHYS\")) %&gt;% # filtering COLMAS out since just one graduate was produced by this college\n  dplyr::select(college, class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  droplevels() # This drops the filtered COLMAS entry\n\n  \ncross_tab &lt;- table(tab)\ncross_tab\n\n\n          class_of_grade\ncollege    Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n  COLAMRUD           3                144                194          20\n  COLANIM            9                238                249          28\n  COLBIOS           16                170                236          16\n  COLENG             3                 64                107          19\n  COLERM            16                168                159          10\n  COLFHEC            5                123                293          12\n  COLPHYS           44                333                225           6\n  COLPLANT           9                290                154           9\n  COLVET             0                 11                 20           2\n\n\nIn this phase of the analysis, the objective is to determine whether there is a significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained among the graduates under study. While the dataset contains a large overall number of observations, certain combinations of college and class of degree — particularly those representing less common degree classifications within specific colleges — have small observed and expected counts. This violates the minimum expected frequency requirement, meaning that the standard Chi-square test’s p-value may be unreliable.\nTo address this issue, the Monte Carlo simulation version of the Chi-square test was employed. This method involves generating a large number of random contingency tables under the assumption of independence, with the marginal totals fixed. For each simulated table, the Chi-square statistic is calculated, and the p-value is estimated empirically as the proportion of simulated statistics equal to or greater than the observed statistic.\nBy using this approach, the analysis accounts for the uneven distribution of observations across categories, ensuring that the statistical inference regarding the relationship between college affiliation and class of degree is both valid and robust, even in the presence of small expected counts in some cells.\n\n\nCode\ncross_tab%&gt;% \n  chisq.test(simulate.p.value = T, B = 3400)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 3400\n    replicates)\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 266.99, df = NA, p-value = 0.000294\n\n\nDecision rule: If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\nConclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between college and academic achievement. Hence, we conclude that there is a difference in college proportion across the class of degree groups.\n\n\nPost-Hoc Test\nThe Monte Carlo Chi-square test of independence revealed a statistically significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained. While this finding establishes that a relationship exists, the Chi-square test does not indicate which specific combinations of categories contribute most to the association. To gain deeper insight, a post hoc analysis will be conducted.\nThrough this post hoc analysis, the study not only confirms the presence of a relationship between college affiliation and class of degree but also pinpoints the specific areas where the patterns differ, thereby providing more actionable and interpretable findings.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(200)\nrcompanion::pairwiseNominalIndependence(cross_tab,\n                            fisher = T,\n                            gtest = F,\n                            chisq = T,\n                            cramer = T,\n                            simulate.p.value = T, \n                            B = 3400\n                           )\n\n\n            Comparison p.Fisher p.adj.Fisher  p.Chisq p.adj.Chisq Cramer.V\n1   COLAMRUD : COLANIM 0.223000     0.259000 0.213000    0.247000   0.0707\n2   COLAMRUD : COLBIOS 0.032000     0.042700 0.046200    0.061600   0.1020\n3    COLAMRUD : COLENG 0.133000     0.165000 0.141000    0.175000   0.0996\n4    COLAMRUD : COLERM 0.000294     0.000623 0.000588    0.001250   0.1560\n5   COLAMRUD : COLFHEC 0.001180     0.002240 0.000294    0.000706   0.1500\n6   COLAMRUD : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2520\n7  COLAMRUD : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2450\n8    COLAMRUD : COLVET 0.779000     0.801000 0.805000    0.828000   0.0473\n9    COLANIM : COLBIOS 0.022100     0.031800 0.024100    0.033400   0.0983\n10    COLANIM : COLENG 0.010000     0.015000 0.009410    0.014600   0.1250\n11    COLANIM : COLERM 0.023200     0.032100 0.021500    0.031000   0.1040\n12   COLANIM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2030\n13   COLANIM : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2070\n14  COLANIM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.1840\n15    COLANIM : COLVET 0.455000     0.512000 0.414000    0.466000   0.0698\n16    COLBIOS : COLENG 0.007350     0.011500 0.006760    0.011600   0.1400\n17    COLBIOS : COLERM 0.063200     0.081300 0.063500    0.081600   0.0964\n18   COLBIOS : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.001180    0.002240   0.1510\n19   COLBIOS : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2060\n20  COLBIOS : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2400\n21    COLBIOS : COLVET 0.537000     0.569000 0.553000    0.603000   0.0678\n22     COLENG : COLERM 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2080\n23    COLENG : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000882    0.001760   0.1690\n24    COLENG : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2970\n25   COLENG : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2990\n26     COLENG : COLVET 0.931000     0.931000 0.833000    0.833000   0.0692\n27    COLERM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.2390\n28    COLERM : COLPHYS 0.004700     0.007690 0.003530    0.006350   0.1160\n29   COLERM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.1580\n30     COLERM : COLVET 0.141000     0.169000 0.149000    0.179000   0.1180\n31   COLFHEC : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.3290\n32  COLFHEC : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000623 0.000294    0.000706   0.3530\n33    COLFHEC : COLVET 0.491000     0.536000 0.575000    0.609000   0.0650\n34  COLPHYS : COLPLANT 0.000588     0.001180 0.000588    0.001250   0.1380\n35    COLPHYS : COLVET 0.002350     0.004030 0.007940    0.013000   0.1580\n36   COLPLANT : COLVET 0.002060     0.003710 0.009700    0.014600   0.1680\n\n\nPost hoc pairwise comparisons using the Chi-square test with Bonferroni adjustment revealed several significant differences in class-of-degree distribution between colleges. Notably, the difference between COLFHEC and COLPLANT was statistically significant (adjusted p = 0.000706) with a Cramér’s V of 0.353, indicating a medium association. Similarly, COLENG vs. COLPHYS (adjusted p = 0.000706, Cramér’s V = 0.297) and COLFHEC vs. COLPHYS (adjusted p = 0.00076, Cramér’s V = 0.329) showed moderate associations. Other significant comparisons, such as COLPHYS vs. COLPLANT (adjusted p = 0.00125, Cramér’s V = 0.138), had smaller effect sizes, suggesting weaker practical differences despite statistical significance.\n\n\n\nCombined Effect of Age, Gender, College Affiliation on the Class of Degree Attained\nThe combined effect of age, gender and college affiliation on the class of degree attained can be examined within the framework of an ordinal logistic regression model, since the class of degree is an ordered categorical outcome. Age may account for variations in academic maturity, while gender could reflect potential disparities in academic engagement or performance. College affiliation captures institutional differences in academic standards, available resources, and programme demands. Modelling these predictors jointly allows for the assessment of both main effects and interaction terms, providing insight into whether the influence of one variable depends on the level of another.

    "text": "Limitations of the Study\n\nModel Evaluation Constraints The study could not fully assess the overall model significance due to incomplete deviance-related outputs. Specifically, the null deviance was unavailable, making it impossible to perform a formal likelihood ratio test to compare the fitted model against a null model. While the AIC was computed, its interpretation was limited without the corresponding null deviance and model comparison context.\nData Availability The analysis was constrained by the availability and completeness of the dataset. Some potentially relevant variables were either missing or aggregated, limiting the ability to explore more granular relationships and potential confounders.\nScope of the Study The study was conducted within a specific context and timeframe, focusing only on the variables included in the available dataset. This scope restriction means the findings may not be directly generalizable to other settings or populations without further validation."

    "text": "Recommendations\n\nSince the chi-square test showed significant associations between certain demographic variables (gender/ college affiliation) and academic performance, students should be aware of the patterns and challenges associated with their group and seek targeted academic support where necessary.\nResults indicate that gender significantly influences the likelihood of attaining higher academic classes. This highlights the importance of encouraging male students to actively seek additional academic support, mentoring, and engagement in learning activities. Student leaders and academic bodies could implement targeted study groups, skill-building workshops, and counseling programs aimed at bridging potential performance gaps.\nWhere performance differences were observed between colleges or demographic categories, students can benefit from cross-college study groups or mentorship to share strategies that work in high-performing clusters.\nStudents falling into categories with lower predicted probabilities of high academic achievement (based on the regression model) should seek academic counselling early, utilize available resources, and adopt structured study plans to improve outcomes."

The ordered logistioc model identified significant predictors and provided interpretable odds ratios, enhancing understanding of how the independent variables influence the likelihood of moving between categories. However, while the findings are insightful, they should be interpreted in light of the study’s limitations, especially regarding sample scope, potential omitted variables, and model assumptions. Future research incorporating broader, more diverse datasets and robust assumption checks will help validate and extend these results."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nHome-field advantage has long been recognised as an important factor influencing team performance in the National Football League (NFL). Across seasons, teams tend to perform differently depending on whether they are playing in familiar, supportive environments or in the stadiums of their opponents. Quantifying this effect provides a useful means of assessing team performance and gaining insights into patterns in scoring behaviour. This study focuses specifically on comparing the goals scored at home and the goals scored away as a proxy for measuring the presence of home-field advantage. By employing the two-sample t-test as the primary statistical technique, the analysis seeks to determine whether the observed differences in scoring across venues are statistically significant. The findings are expected to contribute to a better understanding of performance dynamics in the NFL and provide an empirical basis for evaluating how much location influences team outcomes."

Since home-field advantage plays a central role in this analysis, particular attention is placed on comparing team performance at home versus away. Accordingly, the study is guided by the following specific objectives:\nObjectives of the Analysis\n\nIdentify the Super Bowl Winner by examining the dataset to determine which team emerged victorious in the postseason.\nVisualize Point Differential across teams in order to highlight disparities in aggregate performance and better understand how scoring margins differ across the league.\nExplore the Relationship Between Goals For and Goals Against by producing a scatter plot for each team to evaluate whether teams that score heavily also tend to concede more or less.\nEvaluate the Impact of Venue on Scoring Performance by conducting a two-sample t-test to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between goals scored at home and goals scored away from home."

    "text": "Data Cleaning, Preparation and Analysis\nThis phase of the project commenced with the importation of the necessary R libraries required for efficient data handling, transformation, visualization, and analysis. The core packages included:\n\nnflreadr – for accessing and importing publicly available NFL datasets.\ntidyverse – metapackage\njanitor - for data cleaning\n\nUsing the nflreadr package, the required dataset was imported directly into R; the play-by-play dataset to be precise. The play-by-play dataset for the chosen season was retrieved using the load_pbp() function. Upon loading, dataset structure and variable names were inspected using functions such as glimpse() and dim() to gain a preliminary understanding of its composition.\nThereafter, the first ten rows of the dataset were examined using the head() function to understand the entries of each column. This inspection provided insight into the type of data contained in each variable, the consistency of entries, and potential areas requiring preprocessing. It was observed that entries(game_id) were duplicated to collect data for different play type(kick off, run, pass, punt, no_play, extra_point, field_goal, qb_kneel, qb_spike). Apparently, the dataset contains an exceptionally large number of rows due to its play-by-play structure, where each row represents a single play rather than a single game.

In other words, for most teams, performance does not appear to depend strongly on venue, at least based on goal scoring.\nHowever, there are a few notable exceptions where the p-value is below 0.05, suggesting a significant home-field effect:\n\n\nCode\nhome_away_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Team = c(\"ATL\", \"TEN\", \"PHI\", \"DAL\"),\n  p_value = c(0.00258, 0.01512, 0.01006, 0.01342),\n  mean_home = c(24.00, 22.67, 30.88, 37.38),\n  mean_away = c(14.33, 12.63, 20.67, 23.33),\n  Interpretation = c(\"Scores significantly more at home\",\n                     \"Scores significantly more at home\",\n                     \"Scores significantly more at home\",\n                     \"Scores significantly more at home\")\n)\n\nhome_away_summary %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(p_value, mean_home, mean_away),\n    decimals = 4\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    p_value = \"p-value\",\n    mean_home = \"Mean (Home)\",\n    mean_away = \"Mean (Away)\",\n    Interpretation = \"Interpretation\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam\np-value\nMean (Home)\nMean (Away)\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nATL\n0.0026\n24.0000\n14.3300\nScores significantly more at home\n\n\nTEN\n0.0151\n22.6700\n12.6300\nScores significantly more at home\n\n\nPHI\n0.0101\n30.8800\n20.6700\nScores significantly more at home\n\n\nDAL\n0.0134\n37.3800\n23.3300\nScores significantly more at home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese teams have both (i) p-values below 0.05 and (ii) mean home scores that are substantially higher than mean away scores. This provides statistical evidence of a home-field advantage in scoring for those teams.\nFor a few other teams (e.g., WAS and ARI), the p-values are relatively close to 0.05 (e.g., 0.1621 and 0.06047 respectively). Although these are not statistically significant, they may suggest a weak trend and could become significant with more data."

Only a few teams (such as ATL, TEN, PHI, and DAL) show a statistically significant increase in scoring at home, while for most teams the venue does not appear to influence scoring performance."
