    "text": "Data Exploration, Cleaning, Manipulation and Transformation\nTo begin the analysis, the necessary R packages were loaded, including tidyverse, gt, here, janitor, lubridate, and visdat, which collectively support data manipulation, visualization, and cleaning. Following this, the NYSC dataset was imported into the R environment. An initial assessment was conducted to determine the dataset’s structure, including the number of rows and columns, and to preview the first ten records.\nThe properties of each variable were inspected to understand data types and formats. Special attention was given to the Date of Graduation column, which was found to contain a substantial number of missing values. This observation was first noted during the structure inspection and subsequently confirmed using summary statistics and missing value checks.\nTo preserve confidentiality and ensure ethical data handling, columns containing sensitive or personally identifiable information such as names, phone numbers,jamb registration number and matric numbers were excluded from the working dataset. A new CSV file was then generated to store this modified version of the dataset.\nFinally, data cleaning and transformation were carried out on the refined dataset. This included tasks such as deriving new variables (age and region), and preparing the data for statistical analysis.\n\nData Exploration\n\n\nCode\n#nysc &lt;- read_csv(here(\"Data/NYSC.csv\"))    # Loading the dataset into R\n\n#dim(nysc) # Investigating the dimension of the dataset\n\n#head(nysc, n= 10) # Exploring the first 10 rows of the dataset\n\n#glimpse(nysc)    # Inspecting the dataset\n\n#sum(is.na(nysc$`Date of Graduation`))    # Investigating the number of missing values in the Date of Graduation colunm\n\n#nysc_list &lt;- nysc %&gt;% # Dropping private information columns and the column with no entry\n  #mutate(id = str_sub(JambNumber, -8, -1)) %&gt;% \n  #select(-c(Firstname,Middlename, Surname, MatriculationNo,JambNumber, Phone, `Date of Graduation`)) %&gt;% \n  #select(id, everything())\n  \n\n#write_csv(nysc_list,\"nysc_modified.csv\") # Creating a csv file for the modified dataset\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts/Academic performance/data/nysc_modified.csv\")) # Loading the modified dataset into R\n\nvis_dat(nysc_list_modified) # Visualizing the dataset to investigate it's properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned &lt;- nysc_list_modified %&gt;%    # Cleaning the column name for consistency\n    clean_names()\n\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;%  # Identifying duplicated rows based on matriculation number\n  get_dupes(id)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1,942 × 10\n   id       dupe_count statename  courseof_study   class_of_grade marital_status\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;         \n 1 000108IC          2 Ogun State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n 2 000108IC          2 Ogun State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n 3 001054FH          2 Ogun State AQUACULTURE AND… Second Class … S             \n 4 001054FH          2 Ogun State AQUACULTURE AND… Second Class … S             \n 5 001145HF          2 Ogun State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n 6 001145HF          2 Ogun State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n 7 003265CA          2 Ondo State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n 8 003265CA          2 Ondo State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n 9 003289EF          2 Ogun State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n10 003289EF          2 Ogun State AGRICULTURE/B.A… Second Class … S             \n# ℹ 1,932 more rows\n# ℹ 4 more variables: gender &lt;chr&gt;, date_of_birth &lt;date&gt;, college &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   deptment_code &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;%    # Dropping duplicated rows\n  unique()\n\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% \n  mutate(class_of_grade = factor(class_of_grade,\n                                     levels = c(\"Third Class\",\"Second Class Lower\", \"Second Class Upper\", \"First Class\"), \n                                 ordered = T),\n         gender = factor(gender),\n         college = factor(college))\n\n\n\n\nData Manipulation and Transformation\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Inspecting the entries of each column excluding jamb_number\n  dplyr::select(-id) %&gt;% \n  tbl_summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 3,4061\n\n\n\n\nstatename\n\n\n\n\n    Abia State\n1 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Akwa Ibom State\n3 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Anambra State\n2 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Benue State\n4 (0.1%)\n\n\n    Cross River State\n2 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Delta State\n19 (0.6%)\n\n\n    Ebonyi State\n1 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Edo State\n13 (0.4%)\n\n\n    Ekiti State\n38 (1.1%)\n\n\n    Enugu State\n3 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    FCT\n6 (0.2%)\n\n\n    Imo State\n7 (0.2%)\n\n\n    Kaduna State\n2 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Kogi State\n12 (0.4%)\n\n\n    Kwara State\n16 (0.5%)\n\n\n    Lagos State\n823 (24%)\n\n\n    Niger State\n3 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Ogun State\n1,194 (35%)\n\n\n    Ondo State\n62 (1.8%)\n\n\n    Osun State\n152 (4.5%)\n\n\n    Oyo State\n1,031 (30%)\n\n\n    Plateau State\n2 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Rivers State\n9 (0.3%)\n\n\n    Zamfara State\n1 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\ncourseof_study\n\n\n\n\n    AGRICULTURAL AND BIO-RESOURCES ENGINEERING/B.ENG\n44 (1.3%)\n\n\n    AGRICULTURE/B.AGRIC.\n1,347 (40%)\n\n\n    AQUACULTURE AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT/B.AQFM\n105 (3.1%)\n\n\n    BIOCHEMISTRY/B.SC.\n129 (3.8%)\n\n\n    BOTANY/B.SC.\n98 (2.9%)\n\n\n    CHEMISTRY/B.Sc.\n100 (2.9%)\n\n\n    CIVIL ENGINEERING/B.ENGR.\n43 (1.3%)\n\n\n    COMPUTER SCIENCE/B.Sc.\n141 (4.1%)\n\n\n    ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING/B.ENGR.\n42 (1.2%)\n\n\n    ENTREPRENEURIAL STUDIES/B.SC.\n1 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT & TOXICOLOGY (ENV.

It offers an initial impression of how male and female graduates are spread across the different classifications of academic achievement (such as First Class, Second Class Upper, etc.). While the chart reveals some observable patterns — such as possible concentration or variation in specific degree classes for each gender — it does not offer conclusive evidence of a statistically significant relationship between gender and academic performance.\nGiven that both variables involved are categorical in nature (gender and class of degree), visual inspection alone is insufficient to determine whether an association truly exists between them or if any observed differences are simply due to random variation. Therefore, to formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists between gender and academic performance, it is necessary to conduct a Chi-square test of independence. This test will help determine whether the variables are associated or independent of one another.\n\nChi-Square Test of Independence\nHo: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\nH1: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Parsing gender and class of grade into a table\n  dplyr::select(gender,class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  table()\n\n\n      class_of_grade\ngender Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n     F          23                598                931          65\n     M          83                943                706          57\n\n\nCode\nnysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% # Finding the chi-square test of independence\n  dplyr::select(gender,class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  table() %&gt;%  \n  chisq.test()\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 134.31, df = 3, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nDecision rule: If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\nConclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between gender and academic achievement.

This comparison allows for a broader understanding of how academic outcomes vary not only by gender but also by institutional affiliation.\nAs shown above, the chart provides a visual summary of how graduates from various colleges are represented within each degree classification (for example, First Class, Second Class Upper, and so on). While certain patterns may be visually apparent, such as possible concentrations of specific degree classes within some colleges, these observations are not enough to determine whether a meaningful relationship exists between college and academic performance.\nBecause both variables, college and class of degree, are categorical, visual inspection alone is not sufficient. Any apparent differences might be due to random variation. To formally assess whether a statistically significant relationship exists, a Chi square test of independence is necessary. This will determine whether college affiliation is associated with academic performance or whether the observed differences occurred by chance.\n\nChi-Square Test of independence\nHo: There is no association between gender and academic achievement.\nH1: There is association between gender and academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\ntab &lt;- nysc_list_modified_cleaned %&gt;% #Parsing college and class of grade into a table\n  filter(college %in% c(\"COLANIM\", \"COLAMRUD\",\"COLENG\", \"COLBIOS\", \"COLFHEC\", \"COLERM\", \"COLPLANT\", \"COLVET\", \"COLPHYS\")) %&gt;% # filtering COLMAS out since just one graduate was produced by this college\n  dplyr::select(college, class_of_grade) %&gt;% \n  droplevels() # This drops the filtered COLMAS entry\n\ntab %&gt;% \n  filter(college == \"COLMAS\")\n\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 2\n# ℹ 2 variables: college &lt;fct&gt;, class_of_grade &lt;ord&gt;\n\n\nCode\ncross_tab &lt;- table(tab)\ncross_tab\n\n\n          class_of_grade\ncollege    Third Class Second Class Lower Second Class Upper First Class\n  COLAMRUD           3                144                194          20\n  COLANIM            9                238                249          28\n  COLBIOS           16                170                236          16\n  COLENG             3                 64                107          19\n  COLERM            16                168                159          10\n  COLFHEC            5                123                293          12\n  COLPHYS           44                333                225           6\n  COLPLANT           9                290                154           9\n  COLVET             0                 11                 20           2\n\n\nIn this phase of the analysis, the objective is to determine whether there is a significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained among the graduates under study. The Chi-square test of independence is a widely used statistical method for evaluating such relationships between categorical variables. However, one of its key assumptions is that the expected frequency in each cell of the contingency table should be at least 5.\nWhile the dataset contains a large overall number of observations, certain combinations of college and class of degree — particularly those representing less common degree classifications within specific colleges — have small observed and expected counts. This violates the minimum expected frequency requirement, meaning that the standard Chi-square test’s p-value may be unreliable.\nTo address this issue, the Monte Carlo simulation version of the Chi-square test was employed. This method involves generating a large number of random contingency tables under the assumption of independence, with the marginal totals fixed. For each simulated table, the Chi-square statistic is calculated, and the p-value is estimated empirically as the proportion of simulated statistics equal to or greater than the observed statistic.\nBy using this approach, the analysis accounts for the uneven distribution of observations across categories, ensuring that the statistical inference regarding the relationship between college affiliation and class of degree is both valid and robust, even in the presence of small expected counts in some cells.\n\n\nCode\ncross_tab%&gt;% \n  chisq.test(simulate.p.value = T, B = 3400)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 3400\n    replicates)\n\ndata:  .\nX-squared = 266.99, df = NA, p-value = 0.000294\n\n\nDecision rule: If p-value is less than 0.05, we reject null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\nConclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is enough evidence to conclude that there is association between college and academic achievement. Hence, we conclude that there is association between college and academic achievement.\n\n\nPost-Hoc Test\nThe Monte Carlo Chi-square test of independence revealed a statistically significant association between college affiliation and class of degree attained. While this finding establishes that a relationship exists, the Chi-square test does not indicate which specific combinations of categories contribute most to the association. To gain deeper insight, a post hoc analysis was conducted.\nPost hoc testing in this context serves to identify the exact College–Class of Degree pairs that deviate significantly from the expected counts under the null hypothesis of independence. This was achieved by examining the standardized residuals from the Chi-square test. Standardized residuals represent the difference between the observed and expected frequencies in each cell of the contingency table, expressed in standard deviation units. Large positive residuals indicate that a particular combination occurred more frequently than expected, while large negative residuals indicate it occurred less frequently than expected.\nTo control for the increased risk of Type I errors arising from multiple comparisons, the p-values corresponding to the residuals were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction method. This adjustment ensures that the identification of significant cells remains statistically rigorous.\nThrough this post hoc analysis, the study not only confirms the presence of a relationship between college affiliation and class of degree but also pinpoints the specific areas where the patterns differ, thereby providing more actionable and interpretable findings.\n\n\nCode\nrcompanion::pairwiseNominalIndependence(cross_tab,\n                            fisher = T,\n                            gtest = F,\n                            chisq = T,\n                            cramer = T,\n                            simulate.p.value = T, \n                            B = 3400\n                           )\n\n\n            Comparison p.Fisher p.adj.Fisher  p.Chisq p.adj.Chisq Cramer.V\n1   COLAMRUD : COLANIM 0.231000     0.268000 0.225000    0.261000   0.0707\n2   COLAMRUD : COLBIOS 0.033800     0.045100 0.043200    0.057600   0.1020\n3    COLAMRUD : COLENG 0.133000     0.160000 0.128000    0.154000   0.0996\n4    COLAMRUD : COLERM 0.000294     0.000706 0.000588    0.001180   0.1560\n5   COLAMRUD : COLFHEC 0.000588     0.001180 0.000882    0.001670   0.1500\n6   COLAMRUD : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2520\n7  COLAMRUD : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2450\n8    COLAMRUD : COLVET 0.767000     0.789000 0.819000    0.839000   0.0473\n9    COLANIM : COLBIOS 0.029400     0.040700 0.025000    0.034600   0.0983\n10    COLANIM : COLENG 0.007640     0.012000 0.008530    0.013400   0.1250\n11    COLANIM : COLERM 0.022900     0.033000 0.023800    0.034300   0.1040\n12   COLANIM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2030\n13   COLANIM : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2070\n14  COLANIM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.1840\n15    COLANIM : COLVET 0.468000     0.527000 0.402000    0.452000   0.0698\n16    COLBIOS : COLENG 0.012100     0.018200 0.006760    0.011100   0.1400\n17    COLBIOS : COLERM 0.062600     0.080500 0.059700    0.076800   0.0964\n18   COLBIOS : COLFHEC 0.000588     0.001180 0.000294    0.000662   0.1510\n19   COLBIOS : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2060\n20  COLBIOS : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2400\n21    COLBIOS : COLVET 0.554000     0.587000 0.558000    0.598000   0.0678\n22     COLENG : COLERM 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2080\n23    COLENG : COLFHEC 0.001180     0.002240 0.000588    0.001180   0.1690\n24    COLENG : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2970\n25   COLENG : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2990\n26     COLENG : COLVET 0.926000     0.926000 0.839000    0.839000   0.0692\n27    COLERM : COLFHEC 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.2390\n28    COLERM : COLPHYS 0.007640     0.012000 0.005290    0.009070   0.1160\n29   COLERM : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.1580\n30     COLERM : COLVET 0.126000     0.156000 0.123000    0.153000   0.1180\n31   COLFHEC : COLPHYS 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.3290\n32  COLFHEC : COLPLANT 0.000294     0.000706 0.000294    0.000662   0.3530\n33    COLFHEC : COLVET 0.498000     0.543000 0.565000    0.598000   0.0650\n34  COLPHYS : COLPLANT 0.000588     0.001180 0.000294    0.000662   0.1380\n35    COLPHYS : COLVET 0.002060     0.003710 0.004410    0.007940   0.1580\n36   COLPLANT : COLVET 0.003230     0.005540 0.009110    0.013700   0.1680\n\n\nPost hoc pairwise comparisons using the Chi-square test with Bonferroni adjustment revealed several significant differences in class-of-degree distribution between colleges. Notably, the difference between COLFHEC and COLPLANT was statistically significant (adjusted p = 0.00076) with a Cramér’s V of 0.353, indicating a medium association. Similarly, COLENG vs. COLPHYS (adjusted p = 0.00076, Cramér’s V = 0.297) and COLFHEC vs. COLPHYS (adjusted p = 0.00076, Cramér’s V = 0.329) showed moderate associations. Other significant comparisons, such as COLPHYS vs. COLPLANT (adjusted p = 0.00125, Cramér’s V = 0.138), had smaller effect sizes, suggesting weaker practical differences despite statistical significance.\n\n\n\nCombined Effect of Age, Gender, College Affiliation on the Class of Degree Attained\nThe combined effect of age, gender and college affiliation on the class of degree attained can be examined within the framework of an ordinal logistic regression model, since the class of degree is an ordered categorical outcome. Age may account for variations in academic maturity, while gender could reflect potential disparities in academic engagement or performance. College affiliation captures institutional differences in academic standards, available resources, and programme demands. Modelling these predictors jointly allows for the assessment of both main effects and interaction terms, providing insight into whether the influence of one variable depends on the level of another. This approach ensures a comprehensive statistical evaluation of the multifactorial determinants of academic achievement.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_orl &lt;- polr(class_of_grade ~ age + college + gender, data = nysc_list_modified_cleaned, Hess = T)\n\nsummary(model_orl)\n\n\nCall:\npolr(formula = class_of_grade ~ age + college + gender, data = nysc_list_modified_cleaned, \n    Hess = T)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Value Std.
